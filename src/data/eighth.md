Every developer has a unique setup that he or she likes to work with. The setup can be a physical desk setup or a software setup that he/she use in development.The setup is one thing that boosts the productivity of the developer and it really feels calming in working in your preferred development environment. I like my development setup very much. It includes a neat and minimal desk setup or minimal software setup for development.
