What are YOU doing here? Take what you can, give nothing back If ye can’t trust a pirate, ye damn well can’t trust a merchant either! Why are pirates pirates? cuz they arrrrrr Why is the rum gone? Where there is a sea there are pirates. Work like a captain, play like a pirate. “Yes, I do heartily repent. I repent I had not done more mischief; and that we did not cut the throats of them that took us, and I am extremely sorry that you aren’t hanged as well as we. ”

You can always trust the untrustworthy because you can always trust that they will be untrustworthy. Its the trustworthy you can’t trust. you know, thats the 2nd time I’v watched that man sail away with my ship. Merchant and pirate were for a long period one and the same person. Even today mercantile morality is really nothing but a refinement of piratical morality. Damnation seize my soul if I give you quarters, or take any from you. Whats a pirate’s favorite fast food restaurant? Arrrrbys!
