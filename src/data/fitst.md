# First Page!

It's a first page.

What are YOU doing here? Take what you can, give nothing back If ye can’t trust a pirate, ye damn well can’t trust a merchant either! Why are pirates pirates? cuz they arrrrrr Why is the rum gone? Where there is a sea there are pirates. Work like a captain, play like a pirate. “Yes, I do heartily repent. I repent I had not done more mischief; and that we did not cut the throats of them that took us, and I am extremely sorry that you aren’t hanged as well as we. ”

Ya know, darlin’, I’m 97 percent chum free Come show me how ye bury yer treasure, lad! That’s quite a cutlass ye got thar, what ye need is a good scabbard! “I’ve got a jar of dirt! I’ve got a jar of dirt, and guess what’s inside it?” “Why is the rum always gone?” Fetch me another Cabin Boy…This one be split How much does the pirate pay for an ear piercing? … A buccaneer! (buck- in- ear…)

Avast, me proud beauty! Wanna know why my Roger is so Jolly? Wanna shiver me timbers? I’ve sailed the seven seas, and you’re the sleekest schooner I’ve ever sighted. So, tell me, why do they call ye, “Cap’n Feathersword?” That’s quite a cutlass ye got thar, what ye need is a good scabbard! Why is the rum gone? If ye thinks he be ready to sail a beauty, ye better be willin’ to sink with her. It’s not everyday you get to do a pirate movie, you might as well go for it. Pirate’s code: First freedom and the captain. Second the loot, third woman and the rum and at the end no mercy if they not immediately surrender!

So, tell me, why do they call ye, “Cap’n Feathersword?” There comes a time in most men’s lives where they feel the need to raise the Black Flag. “I’ve got a jar of dirt! I’ve got a jar of dirt, and guess what’s inside it?” “Why is the rum always gone?”

You can always trust the untrustworthy because you can always trust that they will be untrustworthy. Its the trustworthy you can’t trust. you know, thats the 2nd time I’v watched that man sail away with my ship. Merchant and pirate were for a long period one and the same person. Even today mercantile morality is really nothing but a refinement of piratical morality. Damnation seize my soul if I give you quarters, or take any from you. Whats a pirate’s favorite fast food restaurant? Arrrrbys!

Yes, that is a hornpipe in my pocket and I am happy to see you. Brwaack! Polly want a cracker? … Oh, wait. That’s for Talk Like a PARROT Day. That’s the finest pirate booty I’ve ever laid eyes on. If ye thinks he be ready to sail a beauty, ye better be willin’ to sink with her. How much does the pirate pay for an ear piercing? … A buccaneer! (buck- in- ear…) Without the messy paperwork.

I’ve crushed seventeen men’s skulls between me thighs! Merchant and pirate were for a long period one and the same person. Even today mercantile morality is really nothing but a refinement of piratical morality. Well actualy piracy is a democracy with captains voted for by the crew.

Have ya ever met a man with a real yardarm? Not all treasure is silver and gold The rougher the seas, the smoother we sail. Ahoy! you know, thats the 2nd time I’v watched that man sail away with my ship. You will always remember this as the day you almost caught Captain Jack Sparrow. My mom would not let me see the pirate movie because it was rated rrrrr.
